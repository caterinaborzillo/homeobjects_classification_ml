# Home Object Classification task - Machine Learning

Machine Learning project on the implementation of a solution for the images classification task regarding objects in a home environment.

Progetto del corso di Machine Learning sull'implementazione di una soluzione di un task sulla classificazione delle immagini relative agli oggetti in un ambiente domestico.

## Details
The most popular artificial neural networks used for image analysis are Convolutional Neural Networks, also called CNN. In particular, Iâ€™m going to use a CNN to solve an image classification problem starting from a dataset containing about 8000 images. The images the model has to classify belong to 8 classes and the subjects of the pictures are objects typically used in a home environment.

- codes/: directory containing the code solutions to the image classification task
- homeobjects_classification_task.pdf: pdf file with the detailed description of the implemented solution; in the report is mentioned how images of dataset have been preprocessed, which method/algorithm I used, which configurations of the method I tried, there is a description of the evaluation method I used together with the results I obtained (using appropriate metrics). The report compares two different solutions. Conclusions discusses the comparative results. 
- best_trained_model.h5: the best trained model is saved, using the function model.save
